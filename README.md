## ✨ Key Features

- **Noise-Free Extraction:** Powered by Mozilla's Readability engine to remove ads, sidebars, and menus.
- **Structural Integrity:** Unique handling of complex and **nested tables** via semantic HTML preservation — no more broken data rows in your LLM context.
- **RAG-Native Metadata:** Automatically generates a YAML frontmatter block with:
  - `title`: Page title (YAML-escaped)
  - `url`: Direct source link
  - `site_name`: Domain or site title
  - `excerpt`: Short summary/description
  - `scraped_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `length`: Content character count
- **Privacy First:** 100% client-side processing. Your data never leaves your machine. No accounts, no APIs, no tracking.
- **Atomic & Fast:** No bloat, no complex UI. Just the data you need for your LLM context.

## 🧠 Why it's better for RAG?

Standard "Reader Mode" extensions often convert complex tables into a mess of pipes and dashes that small LLMs (like Llama 3 or Mistral) fail to parse correctly. 

**ImpKit Scraper** preserves the hierarchical structure of tables using clean HTML injection within the Markdown. This ensures that:
1. **Nested tables** remain readable.
2. **Contextual relationships** between rows and columns are preserved.
3. **Token usage** is optimized by avoiding redundant markdown formatting characters.
